        <span class="description-title">What is this test?</span>
        <span style="font-size: x-large;">
            <br>
            This is a test to determine 8 basic aspects of your political views. These will be ranked on based on 100
            questions and come in pairs. This came about because I saw some unusual things from other tests like this
            one, including the political compass and 9axes tests. I thought I'd try my hand at creating one, so here it
            is! I got a lot of inspiration for this quiz from the <a href="https://9axes.github.io/">9Axes</a> and <a
                href="https://www.politicalcompass.org/">Political Compass</a> tests for
            design and questions. So check those out as well. A major difference between this test and other similar
            tests is that questions impact multiple different aspects in different ways.

            This aims to test 8 aspects of your political views
            <br>
            1. <span style="color: rgb(255, 122, 122);">Federalism vs Statism</span>
            <br>
            <div style="margin-left: 3%;">
                <span>
                    Federalism is the belief that local or provincial governments should have more say and power than
                    the national government. While statists believe that the national government should be ever
                    controlling.

            2. <span style="color: rgb(180, 208, 20);">Conservatism vs Liberalism</span>
            <div style="margin-left: 3%;">
                <span>
                    Conservative and Liberal in this sense are <em>strictly</em> based on how they treat law making and
                    founding documents like their country's constitution or any other such founding documents.
                    Conservatives learn and strictly adhere to the founding documents of the country. They believe that
                    deviating or overstepping these documents is a terrible act. Liberals tend to see such documents as
                    flexible or unnecessary. They believe that in order to progress society that these documents should
                    be ignored. In essence, conservatives try to stray as little as possible from traditional things or
                    things done in the past, while liberals or progressives will try to push a change to the status quo

            3. <span style="color: rgb(0, 255, 0);">Market vs Equality</span>
            <div style="margin-left: 3%;">
                <span>
                    People with a high market score believe above all else that what rules is one's own intuition,
                    abilities, and intelligence is what it takes to survive. Above all else they believe in equality of
                    opportunity. On the other hand people with a high equality score believe that one is entitled to
                    just a little bit more. They believe it is the duty of everyone to provide for the poor, elderly,
                    and vulnerable. They above all else believe in equality of result. They believe that the market
                    should be regulated to prevent the exploitation of people.

            4. <span style="color: rgb(34, 82, 255);">Authoritarian vs Libertarian</span>
            <div style="margin-left: 3%;">
                <span>
                    Authoritarians believe in absolute power of the few and a strong centralized power. All
                    authoritarians are statists but not all statists are authoritarians. Authoritarians tend to try to
                    consolidate power to a one person dictatorship although this isn't always the case. Libertarians, in
                    the context of this test, hate strong centralised power and prefer free elections.
                </span>
            </div>
            <br>
            5. <span style="color: rgb(0, 242, 255);">Freedom vs Security</span>
            <div style="margin-left: 3%;">
                <span>
                    People with high freedom scores believe in less government regulation as well as strong restrictions
                    against government intervention into personal lives. They also despise those who reject their
                    countries founding documents or other such things because they believe that is the root of their
                    freedom. People with high security scores believe in essence that maybe there are <em>some</em>
                    freedoms that can be curbed in order for the greater good of society.

            6. <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Militarism vs Pacifism</span>
            <div style="margin-left: 3%;">
                <span>
                    Militarists believe that a countries power comes from its military. Above all else their nation must
                    be strong. Militaries are necessary for a nation's continued success, protection, and general power
                    and well-being. Pacifists are the opposite. They believe that war is unproductive, evil, and
                    destructive. They will try the best they can to prevent war. They favor diplomacy over war. Some
                    pacifists may even believe that war even for self-defense should be stopped.

            <br>
            7. <span style="color: rgb(255, 127, 0);">Individualist vs Collectivist</span>
            <div style="margin-left: 3%;">
                <span>
                    Individualists believe that all people because they are individuals themselves have rights these
                    people also tend to have strong believers in capitalism but not always. The US's Founding Fathers
                    were major individualists who believed in rights for individuals. Collectivists believe that rights
                    derive from what group you are in. You are a worker so you get a certain set of rights. They also
                    tend to believe that rights can be given and taken away. Individualist ideas include capitalism,
                    republics, and democracies. While collectivist ideas include redistribution of wealth, Socialism,
                    and Communism.

            8. <span style="color: rgb(35, 204, 32);">Globalism vs Sovereigntism</span>
            <div style="margin-left: 3%;">
                <span>
                    Globalists believe in international organization. They believe that nations should give up some of
                    their power to a world governing organization such as the United Nations. Radical globalists even
                    believe that all borders should be disolved and all countries should swear loyalty to a one world
                    government. Sovereigntists on the other hand believe in the independence of their own nation.
                    Sovereigntism is broken down into two categories where radical sovereigntists adore their nation
                    just because of the nation's name and not the actions of the nation. More moderate sovereigntists
                    are patriots. Patriots believe in the independence of their home based on its charecteristics its
                    actions. They both love their country, just in different ways.
